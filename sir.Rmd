IMAGES:
Insert them with: ![alt text](image.png)
You can also resize them if needed: convert image.png -resize 50% image.png
If you want to center the image, go through HTML code:
<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="image.png"/></div>

REFERENCES:
For references: Put all the bibTeX references in the file "references.bib"
in the current folder and cite the references as @key or [@key] in the text.
Uncomment the bibliography field in the above header and put a "References"
title wherever you want to display the reference list.

## Three representations of an SIR model

### A verbal description
Let's consider $S$ susceptibles, $I$ infectious and $R$ recovered. Susceptibles
become infected at a rate equal to the product of an infectious contact rate
$\beta$ and the number of infectious $I$. Infectious people recover at a rate 
$\gamma$.

### A graphical description

We could sketch the above verbal description as follows:

<div style="text-align:center"><img src ="SIR.png" width="250"/></div>

We have 3 **variables** $S$, $I$ and $R$ which are respectively the numbers of
susceptibles, infectious and recovered, and we have 2 **parameters** $\beta$ and
$\gamma$ which are respectively the infectious contact rate and the recovery
rate.

### A mathematical description

A mathematical description of the above SIR model using the differential
equations formalism looks like:

$$
\frac{dS}{dt} = -\beta \times I \times S\\
\frac{dI}{dt} =  \beta \times I \times S - \gamma\times I\\
\frac{dR}{dt} = \gamma\times I
$$

The basic reproductive ratio R$_0$ for this system is

$$
\mbox{R}_0 = \frac{\beta}{\gamma}N
$$


## Solving differential equations in R

Solving a system of differential equations means finding the values of the
variables (here $S$, $I$ and $R$) at a number of points in time. These values
will depend on the parameters' values. We can numerically solve differential
equations in R thanks to the `ode()` function of the `deSolve` package. If this
package is not installed  on your system, you need to install it:

```{r eval = FALSE}
install.packages("deSolve")
```

To be able to use the `deSolve` package, you need to load it:

```{r}
library(deSolve) # using the "ode" function
```
