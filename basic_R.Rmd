## Before we start

Memory / disk

Use the R help with the `?`

Use [Google](https://www.google.com)! or 
[StackOverflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/r) with the `[r]`
keyword

Command history (use arrows!)

Use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com)

Organize you work in projects in RStudio

Use keyboard [shortcuts](https://support.rstudio.com/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts) in RStudio, in particular for the assingment operator

Refer to the [CRAN website](https://cran.r-project.org)

Make sure that your system (R, RStudio and packages) is up to date. There is a 
new R release every 6 months, even more often than that for RStudio. Type
`update.packages()` at the command line to update the packages

## R as a calculator

```{r}
1 + 2
3 * 4
5 / 6
7 - 8
```

## Variables

Creating variables:

```{r}
a <- 1
b <- 2
c <- 3
```

Listing the variables in the environment:

```{r}
ls()
```

Seeing the content of a variable:

```{r}
a
```

Removing a variable:

```{r}
rm(a)
```

Checking that variable `a` has been removed:

```{r}
ls()
```

Removing several variables at once:

```{r}
rm(b, c)
```

Checking:

```{r}
ls()
```


### Vectors

Basic data structure in R is vector with is and **ordered** collection of 
elements, all the same nature:

```{r}
a <- c(1, 2, 3)
b <- c("a", "b", "c")
```

Selecting elements:
```{r}
a[1]
b[2]
```

Negative selection:

```{r}
a[-2]
# is the same as
a[c(1, 3)]
# and
b[-3]
# is the same as
b[c(1:2)]
```

Additional function to use on vectors:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
length()
head()
tail()
seq()
```

### Data frames

Whereas vectors are 1-dimension structure, data frames are 2-dimension 
structures (they have rows and columns). A data frame is basically a collection
of vectors (organized in columns), all of the same length (the number of rows).
To create a data frame:

```{r}
mydf <- data.frame(name   = c("george", "bob" , "edwin", "richard", "lisa"),
                   gender = c("male"  , "male", "male" , "male"   , "female"),
                   age    = c(23      , 18    , 43     , 21       , 50),
                   stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
```

It looks like this:

```{r}
mydf
```

To positively and negatively select values from a data frame, it's the same as
for vector (i.e. square brackets), except that here we have to provide indexes
for rows and columns separated by a common. Rows are always first. Examples:

```{r}
mydf[, 2]
mydf[3, ]
mydf[-3, ]
mydf[2, 3]
mydf[2:4, c(1, 3)]
mydf[2:4, -1]
```

Reading an excel file:

```{r eval = FALSE}
readxl::dengue2010 <- read_excel("name_of_the_excel_file.xls")
```

### Lists

Lists are a collection of elements which, unlike vectors, do not need to be all
of the same nature. Furthermore elements of a list can themselves be lists,
which give lists the property to be structured objects.

```{r}
my_list <- list(1, 2, 3)
my_list
```

Same as for vector, if you want to select elements of a list, use the single
square brackets `[]`:

```{r}
my_list[2:3]
my_list[-1]
my_list[1]
```

In case you select only one element of the list, you may want to drop the list
structure that you may not need any more. For that, use the double square
brackets `[[]]` instead of single square brackets `[]`:

```{r}
my_list[2]
my_list[[2]]
```

Same as for vectors, you can name the elements of a list:

```{r}
my_list <- list(first = 1, second = 2, third = 3)
my_list
```

And you can use these names instead of indexes to select the elements of a list:

```{r}
my_list[1]
my_list["first"]
my_list[c(1, 3)]
my_list[c("first", "third")]
```

Finally, a very useful function to use on list is the `with()` function: it 
tells, in what list R should be looking for the elements you are talking about.
Exammple:

```{r eval = FALSE}
first + 1
```

returns an error because by default R look for objects in the global 
environment, and there is no such object named `first` in the global 
environment:

```{r}
ls()
```

If you meant the element of the list `my_list` named `first`, then, you can
specify it this way:

```{r}
my_list[["first"]] + 1
```

Note here that we dropped the list structure by the use of the double square
brackets `[[]]`. An alternative to the above command is to use the `with()`
function:

```{r}
with(my_list, first + 1)
```

Here, `with()` tells R to look for an element named `first` in the list named
`my_list`.

#### Advanced

Two advanced points:

* Use of the dollar sign `$`

If you are selecting only one element of a list, then, the tree commands below
are equivalent:

```{r}
my_list[[2]]
my_list[["second"]]
my_list$second
```

* Data frame are lists where all the elements (columns) are all vectors of the 
same length. In consequence, you can also make use of `[[]]` and `$` to select
elements of a data frame as you would do for any regular list:

```{r}
mydf[[2]]
mydf[["gender"]]
mydf$gender
```


## Functions

In R there are 2 categories of objects: the **variables** that we just saw and
which contains data and the **functions** that contains code (i.e. instruction).
Think of functions as a machine that takes inputs (potentially many) and returns
an output (sometimes nothing, but never more than one single output). To define
a function, we still make use of the assignment operator `<-` but here the key
word is `funtion(){}`

```{r}
my_fct <- function(a, b, c) {a + b +c}
```

To see the content of a function, as for any object in R, just type the name of
the function:

```{r}
my_fct
```

If, on the other hand, you want to excecute (or run) the function, you will have
to add the round brackets to the name, possibly with some values for the 
arguments, if needed:

```{r}
my_fct(1, 2, 3)
```

Note also that you can specify the values of these arguemnts, either by 
position, as done above, or by name:

```{r}
my_fct(b = 2, a = 1, c = 3)
```

In which case, you can put the argument in any order, not necessarily the order
of the function's definition.

Note that the key word `function` has 2 parts:
* the round brackets `()` that contains the names of the arguments (i.e. input).
This is call the **user-interface** of the function since it is what the user
has to defined in order to use the function.
* the curly brackets `{}` that contains the instructions to perform (using the
arguments). This is call the **body** of the function.

Note that the output of the function is always the last line (instruction)
of what is in between the curly brackets. Indeed, remember that in R there is
always one instruction per line. The body of the function can contain many 
lines:

```{r}
my_fct <- function(a, b, c) {
  numerator <- a + b
  denominator <- b * c
  numerator / denominator
}
```


## Graphs

```{r}
x <- rnorm(10)
y <- rnorm(10)
```

To do a scatterplot of the x-y coordinate, two options:

```{r}
plot(x, y)
```

or 

```{r}
plot(y ~ x)
```

You can add many arguments to tune your graphs:

```{r}
plot(x, y, col = "red")
plot(x, y, col = "red", pch = 19)
plot(x, y, col = "red", pch = 19, cex = 3)
plot(x, y, col = "red", pch = 19, cex = 3, xlab = "x axis", ylab = "y axis")
plot(x, y, col = "red", pch = 19, cex = 3, xlab = "x axis", ylab = "y axis", 
     main = "title")
plot(x, y, col = "red", pch = 19, cex = 3, xlab = "x axis", ylab = "y axis", 
     main = "title", xlim = c(-10, 10), ylim = c(-5, 5))
plot(x, y, col = "red", pch = 19, xlab = "x axis", ylab = "y axis", 
     main = "title", xlim = c(-10, 10), ylim = c(-5, 5), type = "l")
plot(x, y, col = "red", pch = 19, xlab = "x axis", ylab = "y axis", 
     main = "title", xlim = c(-10, 10), ylim = c(-5, 5), type = "l", lwd = 3)
```

The possibilities are endless. Look on the internet for more options.

### Primary and secondary funtions

There are 2 categories of function to draw graphs. The first category, called
** primary functions** always erase whatever graph that already exists and 
create a new one. This is the case of the `plot()` that we saw above. The other
category, **secondary functions** always add elements to an already existing
graph. If no graph is already created then these secondary functions won't work.

Among the primary functions commonly used are `plot()`, `barplot()`, `hist()`,
plus an endless list of other functions (do your research on the internet).
Among the common secondary functions are `line()`, `abline()`, `points()`,
`legend()`, `axis()`, `title()`, `legend()`, plus many others. Again, do you
research on the internet. Here is an example of the use of a primary and a
secondary functions:

```{r}
# primary
plot(x, y, col = "red", pch = 19)
abline(0, 1, col = "blue", lwd = 2, lty = 2)
```

## Packages

Any instruction in R is done by a function. We've seen quite some of them so
far. These functions are organized in thematic **packages** and there is about
30 such packages that come with the R base installation. For example, the 
`ls()`, `rm()`, `c()`, `list()`, `data.frame()`, `with()`, `length()` functions
are in the **base** package. The `head()` and `tail()` functions are in the
**utils** package, the `nrorm()` function is in the **stats** package, and the
graphs functions that we used above `plot()`, `barplot()`, `hist()`, `points()`,
`abline()`, `legend()` are, unsurprisingly, in the **graphics** package. A cool
thing about R is that it's open source. A consequence of this is that any one
can write his/her own package. Another great feature of R is that these 
user-developped package can be published on the official
[R website](https://cran.r-project.org) for others to use, and that there one
and only one repository for these package (so it's easy to find one's way). As
of 2019, there are more than 13,000 such packages, a list of which you can see
[here](https://cran.r-project.org). You can do you research here by key word,
then click on the link to the package's website, read more detail information,
check for the presence of Vignette, etc... Once you've identify a package that
you'd like to use, you need to install and load it. Installation means writing
the package to disk, this generally comes from the internet and thus requires
and download. Once your package is installed you have the possibility to use it.
To use an installed package, you have to load it from you local disk library.
These two operations can be done either at the command line with the functions
`install.packages()` (from package **utils**) and `library()` (from package
**base**) respectively, or using the packages manager in RStudio. For example,
above, we've been using the function `read_excel()` from the package 
[**readxl**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/readxl) that needed to be
installed and, once installed, loaded. In the SIR modeling, we will use the
package [**deSolve**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/deSolve) and for
the model calibration we will use the package
[**bbmle**](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/bbmle).

## Scripts

Open a new script file and write:

```{r}
# step 1: make a vector of 20 random values,
# normally distributed:
myvar <- rnorm(25)

# step 2: select the first 5 and the last 5 values:
myvar <- myvar[-(6:15)]

# step 3: replace the third value by 3:
myvar[3] <- 3
```

Note that any line starting with the `#` character will be ignored by R. It's
the comment character.

Save the script in `vector selection.R` and source it:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
source('vector selection.R')
```
